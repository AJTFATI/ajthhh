### NEW YEAR, NEW OPPONENT.

The Owls have completed their out-of-conference slate. Now, they face the most important game of the John Jakus era. Florida Atlantic MBB plays the Memphis Tigers today. Memphis comes in as the #21 team in the nation and, more importantly, a festering grudge. For all those who live under a rock, Penny Hardaway and FAU hoops have beef. It all started with the shot heard ‘round Paradise: Nick Boyd’s game-winning layup in March Madness. A jump ball, a boneheaded turnover, and a thrown Powerade bottle all led to the Beach Boys going on their Cinderella run. Saying Penny & the Tigers were a bit peeved would be an understatement. Memphis believes that magical run should’ve been them and isn’t shy about saying it. The all-time series is tied 2-2, but in the Beach Boys/Penny era, the team from SoFlo is 2-1. An outsider might see a Top 25 team visiting a barely .500 team and assume a blowout. That person doesn’t know the history between these two organizations. Florida Atlantic Men’s basketball can win if a few things go right.

#### THE ELLY.

For the Owls to have any chance, they must use their home-court advantage. Elenor R. Baldwin Arena has to be the loudest it’s been all season. FAU Athletics knows this, and have prepared accordingly. The athletic brass has sent out multiple emails to students stating “get back early from break, because you are **not** going to want to miss this one.” Free shirts are also available for the first 750 students.

#### MR FAU KEEPS BALLING

Tre Caroll is the embodiment of FAU. A Florida native, he was on the roster for the magical Cinderella run. He has stepped into a bigger role this season, showing why he was 2x Herald Player of the Year. Carroll put up 24 against #20 Michigan State, shooting 66% from the field. He also is averaging 20ppg and shooting 68% from the field in his past four games. He needs to keep his foot on the gas to help upset the Tigers. The crowd and Carroll would feed off each other to a victory for the Owls.

#### THE BIG FELLAS

Coach John Jakus has a luxury that most of the country does not: the ability to have two 7-footers together on the floor.

Matas Vokietaitis and Baba Miller are two big men with distinctly different styles. Vokietaitis, the big man from Lithuania, is the stereotypical center. He crashes the boards and when he gets hot, he is hell. Vokietaitis plays with a European flair: he represented his country in the FIBA World Cup. Miller is a basketball unicorn who can guard the 1-5, jump out of the gym for a block, and drain a three. He can do this in back-to-back possessions.  The Spaniard is an NBA scout’s dream because of his upside. Both Europeans must stay out of foul trouble for FAU to stand a chance.

### PREDICTION

It won’t be easy: Memphis has a grudge. Fortunately, not all these factors have to go right for a win. The most important piece is the crowd. If the environment is electric, the players will feed off the energy for the conference opener. 3s will be flying from both sides of the court. As the announcer said in the Charleston game, defense will be optional. Expect a high-scoring game that has the crowd on their feet.

Florida Atlantic faces a tough test to start the out of conference play. Against the projected winner of the American, Memphis will be coming for blood.

Most people prefer the Beach over the Mississippi, anyway.
